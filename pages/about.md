Hi, I'm Akhil, a web developer living in Tropical India.


Currently I work for SitePoint as editor of their [JavaScript hubs](https://www.sitepoint.com/learning-hubs/) and technical editor for various books (e.g. [JavaScript: Novice to Ninja](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition), [Jump Start Vue.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-vue-js/) and [Jump Start Web Performance](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-web-performance)).

I also work as a network admin and freelance web dev, where I spend a fair bit of my time working on Rails apps.

Here are some of the places you can find me online:

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_kanaidu)

## Website

This site uses the awesome [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) which updates the original Hyde theme for Jekyll 3.x and adds new functionality.

The [blog is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/jameshibbard/blog) and deployed to my server with love by [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/).
