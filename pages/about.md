Hi, I'm Jim, a web developer living in the sunny north of Germany.

![James Hibbard](https://hibbard.eu/jim.jpg)

Currently I work for SitePoint as editor of their [JavaScript hubs](https://www.sitepoint.com/learning-hubs/) and technical editor for various books (e.g. [JavaScript: Novice to Ninja](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition) and [Jump Start Vue.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-vue-js/)).

I also work for the local university as a network admin / web dev where I spend a fair bit of my time working on Rails apps.

Here are some of the places you can find me online:

- [SitePoint Forums](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/u/James_Hibbard)

## Website

This site uses the awesome [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) which updates the original Hyde theme for Jekyll 3.x and adds new functionality.

The [blog is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/jameshibbard/blog) and deployed to my server with love by [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/).
